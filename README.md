# HW 4 Page Replacement Algorithm

This program is meant to find the total number of page faults from 3 different algorithms: LRU, Optimal, and FIFO. It will display each step along the way for the reference string with its page fault, if it exists, and increment the number by one.

# Features
You are able to type in your reference string (13 numbers exactly) with the number of frames you desire. It will then calculate the amount the number of page faults through each algorithm and display the result. 


# How it works
To run this progrm, launch it in MSVS or any C++ ide. Then, input in 13 numbers, pressing the ENTER key after each number. Ensure the number is positive as there are error handling for any negative number. After you input your 13 numbers, you will enter the amount of frames you wish to have, again this number should be positive and greater than 0. After you input in all of the values, it will run through each algorithm and display the number of page faults.
